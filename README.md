Title: Titanic Survival Prediction Model
Description:
This GitHub repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the survival chances of a five-passenger based on their age, ticket price, and sex. The model utilizes popular libraries such as:
  Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
  NumPy for numerical computations
  PyTorch for building and training the neural network model
  Matplotlib for data visualization
The model was trained on the Titanic dataset and submitted to Kaggle, achieving a 50th percentile score. The repository includes:
  Data preprocessing and exploration
  Model development and training
  Evaluation metrics and visualization
  Kaggle submission and results
Feel free to explore the repository, use the model, and contribute to improve its performance!
